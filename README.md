This repository contains the projects completed during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The internship consisted of **5 hands-on tasks**, each focusing on solving real-world problems using Machine Learning and Python. These tasks helped me strengthen my practical knowledge and skills in data science, ML algorithms, and project implementation.
