# 🌸 IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION - TASK 1

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1** of the internship. The objective is to build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on the measurements of their petals and sepals.

## 📁 Files in this Repository

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `iris_flower_classification.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook with model training, visualization, and evaluation |
| `Iris.csv` | The dataset used for training and testing |
| `README.md` | This documentation file |

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest

The models were evaluated based on accuracy and confusion matrix.

## 📊 Results

All models were tested and compared. The highest accuracy was achieved using the **Random Forest Classifier**, demonstrating strong performance in classifying all three species.

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset is publicly available and can also be downloaded from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). It is included in this repo as `Iris.csv`.
